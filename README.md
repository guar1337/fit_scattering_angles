Experimental nuclear physics aims to deliver data for theoreticians, so they can improve their models. Measurement of differential cross section is one of the simplest experiments there are. So I was told.
My PhD experiment almost failed due to the misalignment of the particle detectors. I tried to solve the problem using machine learning and employed http://ceres-solver.org/
The results were good enough for going forward with my PhD, but I feel like there is a lot of exciting work to do here
